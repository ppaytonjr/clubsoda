# Club Soda

## Concept 
A web application designed to organize meet ups for people with common interests! Club Soda allows members to search/view events based on topics they are interested in.  A user can log in and view events and then save them to the profile they create.  Event information includes the location, date, and start time and can be accessed anytime after adding it to your profile. 

## Process
- UI was primarily built through the Bootstrap framework, including the creation of custom forms.
- Three separate MySQL tables to track users, events, and clubs. 
- Incorporated Passport for secure login functionality.  
- Our founder team split into groups to manage front-end development (Trent and Paul), database management (Jason and Tony), and JS logic/API calls (Zack).
